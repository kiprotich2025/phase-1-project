# **OVERVIEW**
Black Group corporate wants to venture into airlines business. But they are worried because they don't know 
the safest planes to buy. I have been tasked with finding out what planes we can get for our


# **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
1. Is their really any safe plane?
2. Will this actually work?
3. what caused the planes to crash?
4. Are the crafts the problem?


# **DATA UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS**
  ### Source of Data
     This data wa derived from AviationData.csv collected by NTSB
  ### Description of Data
      the file is a csv file (comma separated values). It contains data from air accidents from 1960 - 2023
      It includes the aircrafts model, make, types of engine, dates of crash and many more. There are some with missing values 
  ### Data 
  The dataset has 88889 rows and 30 columns. It has a lot of missing values making it hard to deal with.

# **CONCLUSION**
   Based on the exploratory analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
  * The most common aircraft category involved in accidents is airplanes.
  * The Cessna make has readily available good models but a high number of accidents.
  * Helicopters have a lower number of accidents compared to airplanes.
  * The number of accidents has been increasing over time, with a notable spike in accidents during the 2010s.
  * There is a positive correlation between the number of engines and the number of accidents for airplanes.
    links for presentation
  * Consider investing in more helicopters to reduce the number of accidents and improve overall safety.
  * Monitor the number of accidents over time and adjust safety protocols and training programs as needed.



## Insights
The project shouldn't be considered for real life use as the dataset provided missed a lot of necessary details. Should be used for edcutational purposes only
